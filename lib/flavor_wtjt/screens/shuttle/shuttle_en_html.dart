    <h2>Molotow: The Beating Heart of the WTJT</h2>
    <p>
      For the past few years, the legendary
      <a href="https://molotowclub.com/" target="_blank">Molotow</a> Club on the Reeperbahn has been the beloved home base for
      Weltturbojugendtage. If you’re looking for the place where the big bands play and the energy is off the charts, this is it!
    </p>
    <p>
      Since last year, Molotow has moved—don’t worry, it’s just a couple of meters further down the Reeperbahn, still right in the thick of the action. The new location keeps all the charm and attitude
      you know and love, with a few extra perks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inside, you’ll find two bars to keep your thirst in check, a chill-out area to catch your breath, and a lovely stage that’s seen some unforgettable performances. The sound is always top-notch,
      making every set feel massive, and the space is perfect for a proper moshpit when the crowd goes wild.
    </p>
    <p>
      Molotow is more than just a venue—it’s a meeting point for Turbojugend from all over the world, a place where memories are made, and the spirit of the Kiez comes alive. See you in the pit!
    </p>

    <h2>The St. Pauli Fanshop on the Reeperbahn: Your Home for Kiez Culture</h2>
    <p>
      No visit to Hamburg—especially for a true Kiez rebel—is complete without a pilgrimage to the official
      <a href="https://www.fcsp-shop.com/fcsp-shops/unsere-fanshops/" target="_blank">FC St. Pauli Fanshop</a>
      right on the legendary Reeperbahn! This isn’t just any store; it’s a vibrant hub where the spirit of St. Pauli comes alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stepping inside, you’re immediately immersed in the world of the *Boys in Brown*. From the iconic skull and crossbones merchandise—t-shirts, hoodies, scarves, and flags—to official jerseys, fan
      gear, and quirky accessories, you’ll find everything you need to show your allegiance. It’s the perfect spot to grab a souvenir, deck yourself out for the next match, or just soak in the
      atmosphere.
    </p>
    <p>
      More than just a shop, it’s a meeting point for fans from all over the world, a place where the club’s anti-establishment ethos and community values are palpable. Located in the heart of the
      action, it’s easily accessible and a must-see landmark for anyone who lives and breathes St. Pauli.
    </p>
    <p>
      And while you’re here for Weltturbojugendtage, don’t miss the legendary shows happening on Friday and Saturday! The Fanshop is the perfect place to gear up before heading out to the concerts and
      to connect with fellow Turbojugend and St. Pauli fans. Come by, grab some gear, and feel the pulse of the Kiez!
    </p>

    <h2>MS Tonne: Bands, Booze & Cruise on the Elbe</h2>
    <p>
      When it comes to the legendary Turbo Cruise event, there’s only one boat for us: the
      <a href="https://hafentouristik.hamburg/index.php?htmlsite=partyboot-hamburg" target="_blank">MS Tonne</a>! This floating party palace is our vessel of choice for an unforgettable trip down the Elbe, combining
      everything we love—bands, booze, and a killer cruise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hop aboard and get ready for live music with the city skyline as your backdrop, cold drinks in hand, and the best company you could ask for. The MS Tonne transforms into a rocking venue on the
      water, where the party never stops and the vibes are always high.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether you’re dancing on deck, catching your favorite band, or just soaking in the views, the Turbo Cruise on the MS Tonne is a highlight of Weltturbojugendtage you won’t want to miss. Anchors
      up—let’s set sail!
    </p>

    <h2>Doppelschicht: Our new St. Pauli Drinking Hole</h2>
    <p>
      With the beloved Schlemmereck closing its doors after Herbert’s passing, the search for a new home base led us straight to Doppelschicht—and what a find it’s been! Nestled in the heart of St.
      Pauli, Doppelschicht has quickly become our go-to meeting place and main boozing spot over the last couple of years.
    </p>
    <p>
      The staff here are a welcoming bunch of legends, always ready with a smile and a cold drink. From the very beginning, they’ve embraced the Turbojugend with open arms, making everyone feel right
      at home. Whether you’re catching up with old friends, making new ones, or just looking for a place to start (or end) your night, Doppelschicht is the perfect spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Raise a glass to new traditions and good times – Doppelschicht is where the Turbojugend spirit lives on!
