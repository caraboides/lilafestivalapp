           <h2>WTJT XIX Code of Conduct</h2>
        <p>
          The <b>WTJT XIX Code of Conduct</b> is not a moral authority or a buzzkill.
          It is a reminder that we all – individually and collectively – bear responsibility for respectful coexistence.
        </p>
        <p>
          EVERYONE should feel comfortable and safe at the event.
          With a little care and attention, everyone can contribute to making Weltturbojugendtage XIX a great festival for all participants!
          To make this a success, the organizing Turbojugend St. Pauli e.V., with the support of SAFE Turbojugend, has laid down these principles:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Sexism, racism, homo- and queerphobia, antisemitism, body shaming and other forms of exclusion and discrimination will not be tolerated.</li><br/>
          <li>Turbojugend is a family – family is treated with friendship, loyalty and respect. Act appropriately! This applies to all people at the event and around it – residents and working people in St. Pauli are included here.</li><br/>
          <li>Know your limit for alcohol and drugs. Be considerate of your fellow human beings.</li><br/>
          <li>No means no! Assaultive behavior and other forms of violence will not be tolerated.</li><br/>
          <li>Only the affected person decides what they perceive as abusive behavior or violence and what support they would like. Experiences of those affected will not be questioned.</li><br/>
          <li>If you feel uncomfortable, threatened or harassed or observe something of the sort, you can contact anyone with a SAFE TJ pin, the WTJT production team and the Molotow staff.</li><br/>
          <li>Don’t be an asshole!</li><br/>
        </ol>
