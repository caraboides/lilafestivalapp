                                    <p>The airfield Obermehler near the city of Schlotheim is for the second time home
                                        of the Party.San festival, edition 27. Because of using an airfield area some
                                        special codes of behaviour are necessary. Details later. For the first time ever
                                        we present the so-called underground stage with five bands a day. Altogether 57
                                        bands play the Party.San in 2023. Naturally we hope being spared from damages,
                                        severe wheater and band refusals. Party.San takes place from 10.08.2023 to
                                        12.08.2023.</p>

                                    <p>Again we have two stages. Bands play the main stage from thursday on. Stage two
                                        is the tent stage, where we present for the first time a second official stage
                                        (underground stage) for seven bands a day. The tent stage is also in use for our
                                        aftershow parties supported by our two thuringian radio stations "The New Noise"
                                        and "Hellborn Metal Radio". The morning pint has proved very popular last year,
                                        so in 2023 a band is playing again on this occasion.</p>

                                        There will be enough free-to-use portable toilets in place. These are located
                                        next to the light towers on the runway and can be easily seen. The toilets will
                                        be cleaned daily several times. As last year we provide two sanitary bases with
                                        flush toilets and showers. The bases are located on the camping area (south)
                                        next to the runway and can be easily seen, too. The so-called flatrate ticket
                                        for using both toilets and showers is available again. Get it at service points
                                        or box office.</p>

                                        Of course there will be facilities for hand washing and water intake on the

                                    <p>
                                        Located between main and backstage entrance you can find a beer garden in
                                        addition to the wellknown breakfast tent, opened from wednesday evening. The
                                        party tent opens from thursday August 8, daily between 7pm and 3am. Of course we
                                        stage our notorious daily after show parties.</p>

                                    <p>Some words about the unwelcomed issue of political acting and showcasing of
                                        political excesses. The shirt ban for national socialist and/or NSBM motives
                                        remains in force! The ban is valid for the entire festival and camping area. In
                                        fact we see a remarkable improvement over the last years but we have to make
                                        clear that we donยดt tolerate political shit or the slightest provocation either!
                                        This is something for all sides of political display. Raw offenses always
                                        involve a report to the police.&nbsp;</p>

                                    <p class="western">Monkeypox is caused by the monkeypox virus (also known as
                                        monkeypox virus, MPXV). Monkeypox is mild in most people and usually heals on
                                        its own. However, severe courses can also occur (especially in children or
                                        people with a weakened immune system).</p>

                                        <li class="western">Close skin-to-skin contact during sex or close hugging,
                                            massaging and kissing with an infected person, especially contact with that

                                    <p class="western">Monkeypox can be transmitted from the onset of symptoms.
                                        Currently, transmission through close skin-to-skin contact is observed as the
                                        main route of transmission. Only when all wounds, including the scab, have
                                        healed and a new layer of skin has formed, one is no longer contagious. This can
                                        take several weeks. Cases of monkeypox first appeared in Germany and many other
                                        countries in May 2022.</p>

                                        We have commited ourselves to pass the camping area cleaned to its owner two
                                        days after the festival. We can not realise it only with our crew as before.
                                        I.e. we have to hire a well rewarded specialist company. So there is no other
                                        way than to charge a fee for parking and garbage disposal. The fee for cars will
                                        be 10 Euros. For caravans/motorhomes, coaches or cars with trailers there will
                                        be a 20 Euros fee. Garbage bags are distributed as before. Of course you get the
                                        Party.San calendar if you give it back well-filled. We thank you for your

                                        the campers of the reserved areas to leave unnecessary items at home and to keep
                                        your camping site mostly clean during the festival.</p>
                                    <p>For a better handling of the waste disposal, we will place containers in various
                                        sectors of the area. They will be emptied out several times a day if necessary.
                                        Every visitor agrees either to take back home his tents and pavilions or to
                                        dispose it. For disposal use the provided containers only. Furthermore, you

                                        caravans. It is not possible to camp freely on the camper area! The use of the
                                        camper area is subject to the "Green Camping" guidelines at the Party.San Metal

                                    <p>Arrival from 09.08.2023 at 10:00 a.m.<br> Departure on 13.08.2023 until 15:00

                                    <p>The usage fee is 85,60 โฌ per camper or caravan with towing vehicle and can be
                                        purchased as a ticket. The purchase of the camper ticket exempts from the
                                        purchase of a parking vignette at the box office. The purchase of a festival
                                        ticket remains unaffected. I.e. everyone arriving must have a ticket, or buy one
                                        at the box office. As we have limited space the tickets are limited to 50
                                        pieces.</p>
