                    <p>Traveling by train is no problem. Mühlhausen has a direct connection to Göttingen and Erfurt. The
                      approx. 15 km route from Mühlhausen to Schlotheim / Obermehler is served by the Party.San shuttle
                      bus and a public intercity bus every hour. The exact times of the Party.San shuttle bus will be
                      announced on the <a href="/en/informations/bus-shuttle">website</a> in good time. However, it is
                      already foreseeable that it will stop daily at around 18:00 and / or will take the hotel sleepers to
                      Mühlhausen once again at night.</p>

                    <p>As Party.San takes place on an airfield, even more attention must be paid to the tidiness and
                      cleanliness of the areas during the stay and separately on departure.</p>
                    <p>We have undertaken to hand over the camping areas to the owner 2 days after the festival in a clean
                      condition. It is therefore necessary to charge a fee for parking and waste disposal. This will be
                      €15.00 for cars and €25.00 for caravans / coaches or vehicles with trailers. Garbage bags will be
                      handed out free of charge. If you hand in a well-filled garbage bag, you will receive a Party.San
                      Metal Open Air annual calendar at the garbage collection point as a small bonus. We hope for your
                      understanding and would like to thank everyone who leaves their site clean.</p>

                    <p>The following is prohibited on both the campground and the infield:</p>

                    <p>The fee for parking will be €15.00 for cars and €30.00 for caravans / coaches or vehicles with

                    <p>Price increases, as in previous years, can sometimes be attributed to the recurring damage caused
                      by our guests. Should damage occur for which we are held liable, we will have to pass the costs on
                      to the prices in future years. The Party.San Metal Open Air tries to offer the metal community a
                      fair alternative, but we need your support and attention!</p>
                    <p>Your vehicle can be parked directly next to the tent. Without a valid ticket and the corresponding
                      parking vignette, it is not permitted to enter or drive on the entire festival site, including all

                    </div>
                    <p>In der GREEN CAMPING AREA bzw. in den reservierten Camping-Arealen gelten einige besondere
                      Campingregeln, die alle Besucher einhalten sollten, die in diesem Bereich campen möchten.</p>
                    <p>Die Sauberkeit des Camping-Areals liegt uns sehr am Herzen, daher fordern wir die Nutzer der
                      reservierten Flächen auf, unnötige Campingutensilien und Verpackungen gleich zuhause zu lassen und
                      euren Zeltplatz während des Festivals weitestgehend sauber zu halten.</p>
                    <p>Zur Erleichterung der Abfallentsorgung werden in der Area an verschiedenen Punkten Sammelgefäße für
                      Müll aufgestellt, die täglich, bei Bedarf auch mehrmals, entleert werden. Jeder Besucher erklärt
                      sich bereit, die von ihm aufgestellten Zelte und Pavillons nach der Veranstaltung auch wieder mit
                      nach Hause zu nehmen oder selbst in den vor Ort bereitgestellten Müllsammeltonnen zu entsorgen. Ihr
                      stimmt außerdem zu, am Abreisetag euren Restmüll vollständig an der Müllannahmestation abzugeben
                      oder in den bereitgestellten Abfallbehältern zu entsorgen.</p>
                    <p>Es dürfen Zelte und Pavillons aufgebaut werden, aber keine sonstigen Bauten. Campingstühle und
                      -tische sind, im Gegensatz zu großen Möbel wie Sesseln, Sofas, Betten und Kühlschränke, natürlich
                      zulässig.<br> <br> Das Mitbringen und der Betrieb von Stromaggregaten ist wie auf allen anderen
                      Flächen untersagt. In der Zeit von 02:00 Uhr - 08:00 Uhr bitten wir, die Nachtruhe der
                      Campingnachbarn zu respektieren. Das heißt nicht, dass auf den reservierten Flächen keine Musik
                      gehört werden darf, sondern dass diese auf Wunsch der Nachbarschaft auf ein erträgliches Maß
                      reduziert werden muss.</p>
                    <p>Kommt es bei einzelnen Gruppen zu Verletzungen der Richtlinie, führt dies zum dauerhaften
                      Ausschluss aus den Reservierungsmöglichkeiten.</p>

                      for filling internal water tanks and a waste water emptying point at a central supply and disposal
                      point. No waste water may be disposed of illegally. A caravan is a vehicle or caravan with a
                      permanently installed power connection or a total weight of more than 2.8 tons with an awning or a
                      small tent (max. 2 persons). The operation of gas systems is only permitted with a current gas test
                      in accordance with the generally applicable guidelines.</p>
                    <p>Please note that the motorhome site may only be used by motorhomes or caravans. It is not possible
                      to camp freely on the motorhome area! The use of the WoMo area is subject to the Green Camping
                      guidelines (see above).</p>
                    <p>The purchase of the WoMo ticket exempts you from purchasing a parking sticker at the box office.
                    </p>
                    <p>Attention: Sticker vignettes will be issued on site at the festival!</p>
